## Features

### Clear Functions

**Clear (C)**
- Clears the current number you're typing
- Keeps previous calculations in memory
- Use when you mistype a number

**All Clear (AC)**
- Resets the calculator completely
- Clears all stored operations and results
- Use when starting a new calculation

### Error Handling

**Division by Zero**
- If you divide by zero, you'll see: "Error: Cannot divide by zero"
- Press C or AC to clear the error
- Type a new number to start fresh

**Invalid Input**
- Calculator prevents invalid inputs automatically
- For example, you can't type multiple decimal points
- If an operation is invalid, nothing happens

### Decimal Precision

- Results are displayed with up to 10 decimal places
- Trailing zeros are automatically removed
- Example: 10 ÷ 3 = 3.3333333333

## Tips and Tricks

### Quick Calculations

**Double a Number**
```
Type: 5 * 2 =
Result: 10

Or multiply by itself:
Type: 5 * =
Result: 25
```

**Percentage Calculations**
```
Find 20% of 50:
Type: 50 * 0.20 =
Result: 10

Or: 50 * 20 / 100 =
Result: 10
```

**Tip Calculator**
```
15% tip on $50:
Type: 50 * 0.15 =
Result: 7.5

Total with tip:
Type: 50 + (result from above) =
Result: 57.5
```

### Speed Tips

1. **Use Keyboard** - Much faster than clicking buttons
2. **Use Enter** - Instead of clicking the equals button
3. **Chain Operations** - Don't press = after each step
4. **Use Clear Wisely** - C for mistakes, AC for new calculations

### Common Patterns

**Converting Fractions to Decimals**
```
1/3 = ?
Type: 1 / 3 =
Result: 0.3333333333
```

**Averaging Two Numbers**
```
Average of 10 and 20:
Type: (10 + 20) / 2 =
Note: Use parentheses by calculating 10 + 20 first, then divide by 2

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Is this calculator really free?**

A: Yes, completely free. No ads, no accounts, no hidden fees.

**Q: Do I need to create an account?**

A: No. Just open and use.

**Q: Does it work offline?**

A: After the first load, the calculator works offline on most browsers.

**Q: Is my data private?**

A: Yes. All calculations happen in your browser. Nothing is sent to a server or stored anywhere.

### Usage Questions

**Q: How do I calculate percentages?**

A: Convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply.
- 20% of 50 = 50 × 0.20 = 10
- Or: 50 × 20 ÷ 100 = 10

**Q: Why can't I add more decimal points?**

A: Only one decimal point is allowed per number to prevent errors.

**Q: What does "Error: Cannot divide by zero" mean?**

A: You tried to divide a number by zero, which is mathematically undefined. Press C or AC and try again.

**Q: Can I use parentheses for order of operations?**

A: Not in the MVP version. Calculate operations in steps instead:
- For (5 + 3) × 2:
  - First: 5 + 3 = 8
  - Then: 8 × 2 = 16

### Technical Questions

**Q: Why does 0.1 + 0.2 equal 0.3000000000004?**

A: This is normal for computers due to floating-point precision. The calculator rounds results to eliminate most precision errors.

**Q: What's the maximum number I can enter?**

A: Very large numbers (up to JavaScript's Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER: 9,007,199,254,740,991)

**Q: How many decimal places are supported?**

A: Up to 10 decimal places in results.
