# Stablecoin Gateway
## Market Positioning Strategy - Executive Summary

**Date**: January 28, 2026
**Prepared By**: Product Strategist
**Status**: Final Recommendations

---

## Slide 1: The Opportunity

### Market Context
- **19%** of US merchants accept crypto payments (2026)
- **82%** growth forecast in crypto payments (2024-2026)
- **$10B+** addressable market for stablecoin payments

### The Problem
- Stripe charges **2.9%** for credit cards, **1.5%** for crypto
- SaaS companies lose **$25,000/year** on $5M revenue to fees
- No provider offers **both** premium DX **and** low fees

### Our Solution
**"The Stripe of Stablecoins"**
Premium developer experience at 0.5% fees

---

## Slide 2: Competitive Landscape

### Pricing Comparison (per transaction)

| Provider | Fee | Annual Cost on $5M Revenue |
|----------|-----|----------------------------|
| **Stripe Credit Card** | 2.9% | **$145,000** 💸 |
| **Stripe Crypto** | 1.5% | $75,000 |
| **PayPal Crypto*** | 0.99%/1.5% | $49,500-$75,000 |
| **Coinbase Commerce** | 1.0% | $50,000 |
| **BitPay** | 2.0% | $100,000 |
| **Stablecoin Gateway** | **0.5%** | **$25,000** ✅ |

*PayPal promotional rate ends July 2026

### Our Competitive Gap
✅ **Stripe-quality developer experience**
✅ **Coinbase-level pricing (actually better)**
✅ **No competitor offers both**

---

## Slide 3: The Strategic Wedge

### Our Unique Position

```
                High Developer Experience
                          ▲
                          │
                  ┌───────┴───────┐
                  │   STABLECOIN  │
                  │    GATEWAY    │ ← Our Position
                  │   (0.5% DX)   │
                  └───────────────┘
                          │
    Stripe          ◄─────┼─────►      Coinbase
   (1.5% DX)              │          (1% Basic)
                          │
                  Low Fees ─────► High Fees
```

**The Gap Nobody Fills:**
Premium DX at disruptive pricing

---

## Slide 4: Target Market Priority

### Phase 1: SaaS Companies ($100k-$2M ARR)

**Why This Segment First?**
- ✅ **40%** adopting crypto payments by 2026
- ✅ Technical founders (self-serve integration)
- ✅ Cost-sensitive (pre-Series A, optimizing runway)
- ✅ High word-of-mouth (networked founders)
- ✅ Stripe power users (know what good DX looks like)

**Persona: David (28, SaaS Co-Founder)**
- Uses Stripe today, pays 2.9%
- Technical (can integrate API in 2 hours)
- Needs: "Stripe's API quality at better fees"
- Pain: "We're bleeding $12k/year in fees"

### Phase 2-3: Creators & Crypto-Native

**Digital Creators** ($50k-$250k)
- Fleeing 10-30% platform fees (Gumroad, Udemy)
- Global customer base
- Needs: Simple payment button, no crypto complexity

**Crypto-Native Merchants** ($100k-$1M)
- Customers already have wallets
- Currently using Coinbase Commerce (1%)
- Needs: Better DX + lower fees

---

## Slide 5: Value Proposition by Segment

### For SaaS Founders
> "The payment API you already know, at fees you've always wanted"

**Key Benefits:**
- 🚀 2-hour integration (Stripe-quality SDK)
- 💰 Save $25k/year on $5M revenue
- 🔒 Non-custodial (no license hassles)
- ⚡ 30-120 second settlement vs Stripe's 2-7 days

### For Digital Creators
> "Keep 99.5% of your revenue. No platform fees. No PayPal holds."

**Key Benefits:**
- 💸 0.5% vs Gumroad's 10% or Udemy's 30%
- 🎨 No-code payment button (5-min setup)
- 🌍 Global reach (300M+ wallet users)
- 💳 No PayPal account freezes

### For Crypto Merchants
> "Half the fees of Coinbase Commerce, 10x better developer experience"

**Key Benefits:**
- 💰 0.5% vs Coinbase's 1%
- 🔧 Stripe-quality API + webhooks
- 📊 Built-in analytics (Coinbase lacks this)
- 🔄 Subscription billing (Phase 2)

---

## Slide 6: Positioning Strategy

### Core Position
**"The Stripe of Stablecoins"**
- Developer-first payment gateway
- Stablecoin-only (zero volatility)
- Non-custodial architecture
- Sub-1% fees

### Positioning vs. Stripe
**"Complement, Not Replace"** (for MVP)

**Message:**
> "Keep Stripe for credit cards. Add us for stablecoins. Save $X/year."

**Why Complement?**
- ✅ Reduces merchant friction (dual processing is common)
- ✅ Enables case studies ("We saved $12k by adding Stablecoin Gateway")
- ✅ Builds trust ("We work alongside Stripe, not against them")

**Phase 3: Become Replacement**
- After adding subscriptions, invoicing, tax tools
- Then position as: "The better Stripe"

---

## Slide 7: Pricing Strategy

### Recommended Pricing (MVP)
- **Transaction Fee**: **0.5%** flat
- **Monthly Fee**: **$0**
- **Setup Fee**: **$0**
- **Free Tier**: **None**

### Rationale

✅ **Disruptive**
- Undercuts all competitors by 50-75%
- $25,000 savings on $5M revenue is undeniable

✅ **Simple**
- No tiers, no surprises, no bait-and-switch
- "Half a percent!" is memorable and shareable

✅ **Profitable**
- Polygon gas: $0.01 per transaction
- Infrastructure: ~$0.02 per transaction
- 0.5% margin: $25 on $5,000 payment

### Future Evolution (Month 6-12)

**Tiered Pricing:**
- 0-$100k/mo: 0.5%
- $100k-$500k/mo: 0.4%
- $500k+/mo: 0.3% (enterprise)

**Pro Tier ($99/mo):**
- Subscription billing
- Advanced analytics
- Team roles & permissions
- Priority support
- White-label checkout

---

## Slide 8: Go-to-Market Plan

✅ **Stripe's Strategy**: Grew to $95B via developer community

- Payback: <3 months

---

## Slide 12: Risk Mitigation

### Critical Risks & Contingencies

**Risk 1: Stripe drops to 0.5%**
- **Impact**: Eliminates fee advantage
- **Mitigation**: Differentiate on non-custodial, launch subscription billing first
- **Contingency**: Pivot to B2B white-label

**Risk 2: Regulatory Crackdown**
- **Impact**: SEC classifies stablecoins as securities
- **Mitigation**: Geo-fence US, expand EU/LATAM, partner with licensed entities
- **Contingency**: Add KYC/AML (expensive but enables compliance)

**Risk 3: Low Wallet Adoption**
- **Impact**: Customers don't have wallets, conversion suffers
- **Mitigation**: Partner with on-ramps (Moonpay, Ramp), add "Buy USDC" button
- **Contingency**: Target merchants with crypto customers only

**Risk 4: Payment Success <90%**
- **Impact**: Blockchain congestion, gas spikes cause failures
- **Mitigation**: Default to Polygon (low fees), add Layer 2s for redundancy
- **Contingency**: Subsidize gas for first 10 payments per merchant

---

## Slide 13: Competitive Response Playbook

### If Stripe Launches 0.5% Stablecoin Payments

**Response Strategy:**
1. **Emphasize non-custodial**: "Stripe holds your funds, we don't"
2. **Launch feature Stripe doesn't have**: Subscription billing, anonymous payments
3. **Offer migration incentive**: "Switch from Stripe, get 90 days free"
4. **Lean into indie narrative**: "Built by developers, for developers"

### If PayPal Extends 0.99% Indefinitely

**Response Strategy:**
1. **Attack custodial model**: "PayPal freezes accounts, we don't"
2. **Target developers who hate PayPal**: Poor API, walled garden
3. **Offer affiliate program**: 20% referral fees (PayPal offers none)

### If Well-Funded Competitor Launches

**Response Strategy:**
1. **Stay nimble**: Ship features faster than committee-driven product
2. **Community-driven roadmap**: Let merchants vote on features
3. **Indie/underdog narrative**: Compete on authenticity, not funding
4. **Explore acquisition**: If competitor offers >$10M
