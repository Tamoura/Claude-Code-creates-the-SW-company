## Unit Economics

### Per-Transaction Economics

**Average Transaction**: $100
**Transaction Fee (0.5%)**: $0.50
**Costs**:
- Blockchain gas: $0.01 (Polygon)
- RPC call: $0.001 (Alchemy)
- Infrastructure: $0.02 (AWS, database)
- Support (amortized): $0.01
**Total Cost per Transaction**: $0.041

**Gross Profit per Transaction**: $0.459
**Gross Margin**: 91.8%

### Per-Merchant Economics

**Average Merchant (Year 1)**:
- Monthly volume: $10,000
- Transactions per month: 100 (avg $100 each)
- Monthly revenue: $50 (0.5% × $10k)
- Monthly cost: $4.10 (100 × $0.041)
- Monthly profit per merchant: $45.90

**LTV Calculation**:
- Monthly profit: $45.90
- Average lifetime: 24 months
- Churn-adjusted: 70% retention
- LTV = $45.90 × 24 × 0.7 = $771

**With Pro Tier ($99/mo)**:
- Transaction profit: $45.90
- Subscription profit: $99 - $10 (support cost) = $89
- Total monthly profit: $134.90
- LTV = $134.90 × 24 × 0.8 = $2,590

---

## CAC Payback Analysis

### Scenario 1: Community-Led (Months 1-3)
**CAC**: $0
**Monthly Profit**: $45.90
**Payback**: Immediate

### Scenario 2: Referral Program (Months 4-6)
**CAC**: $50 (20% of Year 1 LTV = $154)
**Monthly Profit**: $45.90
**Payback**: 1.1 months

### Scenario 3: Paid Marketing (Months 7+)
**CAC**: $100 (via content marketing, SEO)
**Monthly Profit**: $45.90
**Payback**: 2.2 months

**Target Payback**: <3 months (healthy SaaS benchmark)

---

## Funding Strategy

### Bootstrap Approach (Recommended)

**Why Bootstrap:**
- ✅ $0 capital required (community-led GTM)
- ✅ Profitable by Month 2
- ✅ Self-sustaining by Month 6
- ✅ Founder control (no dilution)
- ✅ Forces discipline and PMF focus

**Risks:**
- Slower growth (can't hire sales team)
- Manual processes (can't hire ops team)
- Limited marketing budget

**Mitigation:**
- Automate aggressively (no-code tools)
- Community-led growth (free)
- Focus on product-led growth (PLG)

### If Raising Capital (Alternative)

**Amount**: $500k seed round
**Use of Funds**:
- $200k: 2 engineers (backend + frontend)
- $150k: 1 growth marketer
- $100k: Marketing budget (content, SEO, ads)
- $50k: Buffer/runway

**Impact**:
- 3x faster growth (450 merchants by Month 6)
- Earlier profitability (Month 4)
- Faster feature development (subscriptions, analytics)

**Trade-off**:
- 15-20% dilution
- Board seat + reporting overhead
- Pressure to grow vs. focus on PMF

**Recommendation**: Bootstrap first 6 months, raise after PMF proven.

---

## Risk-Adjusted Projections

### Conservative Case (70% probability)
- 100 merchants by Month 6 (vs 150 target)
- $1.5M volume (vs $2M target)
- $7.5k MRR (vs $10k target)
- Still profitable by Month 4

### Base Case (50% probability)
- 150 merchants by Month 6
- $2M volume
- $10k MRR
- Matches projections above

### Optimistic Case (20% probability)
- 250 merchants by Month 6
- $3.5M volume
- $17.5k MRR
- Faster PMF, viral growth

### Worst Case (10% probability)
- 50 merchants by Month 6
- $500k volume
- $2.5k MRR
- Reassess PMF, pivot if needed

---

## Key Assumptions & Validation Plan

### Critical Assumptions

**Assumption 1: 30% Signup → Active Merchant Conversion**

- **Validation**: Track churn from Month 2
- **Red Flag**: >10% churn
- **Action**: Improve product stability, add features

**Assumption 4: 20:1 LTV:CAC Ratio**
- **Validation**: Calculate after Month 3 (enough data)
- **Red Flag**: <10:1 ratio
- **Action**: Reduce CAC (more community-led) or increase LTV (Pro tier)

**Assumption 5: Community-Led GTM Works ($0 Marketing)**
- **Validation**: Month 2 launch (Indie Hackers, HN, PH)
- **Red Flag**: <50 signups from community
- **Action**: Experiment with paid ads, content marketing
