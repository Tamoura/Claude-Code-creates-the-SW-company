# 5. Co-Founders

**Audience**: Potential or current co-founders
**Goal**: Full transparency on vision, risks, equity, commitment
**Tone**: Honest, partnership-oriented, long-term
**Duration**: 30-45 minutes (deep dive conversation)

---

## Slide 1: Cover
**Title**: Stablecoin Gateway - Co-Founder Deck

**Visual**:
- Company logo
- "Building the Stripe of Stablecoins"

**Date**: [Date]
**Purpose**: Full context on company, opportunity, and partnership

**Note**: This is a partnership conversation, not a pitch. Let's be honest about everything.

---

## Slide 2: The Opportunity (Big Picture)
**Title**: Why This is a Once-in-a-Decade Opportunity

**The Macro Trend**:
- Stablecoins are becoming the internet's native currency
- $150B market cap (2025) → $1T projected (2030)
- 300M users today → 1B+ by 2030
- Regulatory clarity achieved (2025 legislation)

**The Market Pain**:
- Merchants pay $93B/year in credit card fees
- They WANT alternatives (73% would consider crypto)
- But crypto UX is terrible (Coinbase Commerce is clunky)

**The Wedge**:
- We can offer 5x lower fees (0.5% vs 2.9%)
- With Stripe-level UX (we're engineers who care)
- Non-custodial = no regulatory burden

**The Timing**:
- Stablecoins hit critical mass NOW
- Merchants desperate for lower fees NOW
- Regulatory environment favorable NOW

**Why We'll Win**:
- First-mover with great UX
- Developer-first (network effects)
- Non-custodial (regulatory moat)

**The Prize**:
If we capture 1% of online payments:
- $30B volume/year
- $150M revenue (0.5% fee)
- $100M+ valuation

---

## Slide 3: The Vision (5-10 Year Horizon)
**Title**: Where We're Going

**Year 1** (2026): **Launch & PMF**
- 500 merchants
- $12M payment volume
- $60k revenue
- Prove product-market fit

**Year 2** (2027): **Scale Core Product**
- 2,000 merchants
- $120M volume
- $600k revenue
- Add fiat off-ramp (USDC → bank account)

**Year 3** (2028): **Become Default Choice**
- 5,000 merchants
- $600M volume
- $3M revenue
- WooCommerce, Shopify, Stripe plugins
- Series A funding ($5M-$10M)

**Year 5** (2030): **Market Leader**
- 20,000 merchants
- $6B volume
- $30M revenue
- International expansion
- Enterprise features

**Year 10** (2035): **Exit or IPO**
- 100,000+ merchants
- $100B+ volume
- $500M+ revenue
- **Exit options**:
  - Acquisition by Stripe/PayPal ($500M-$2B)
  - IPO ($5B+ valuation)

**Personal Outcome** (for co-founders):
- Equity: 20-40% each (depending on stage)
- Potential payout: $50M-$500M (in 10 years)
- But more importantly: Build something that matters

---

## Slide 4: The Problem (Deep Dive)
**Title**: Why Credit Cards Suck for Merchants

**Problem 1: Fees Are Absurd**
- Interchange fee: 1.5-2.0% (goes to banks)
- Payment processor fee: 0.5-1.0% (Stripe, PayPal)
- Assessment fee: 0.1-0.15% (Visa, Mastercard)
- **Total: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction**

Example:
- $100 sale → merchant gets $96.80
- $1M/year sales → $29,000 in fees 😱

**Problem 2: Settlement is Slow**
- Stripe: 2-7 days
- PayPal: 3-5 days
- ACH: 5-7 days
- **Cash flow killer** for small businesses

**Problem 3: Chargebacks Are Broken**
- Customer disputes charge → merchant loses money + $15 fee
- Fraud rate: 0.5-1% of revenue
- Legitimate businesses lose $31B/year to chargebacks

**Problem 4: Geographic Limitations**
- 2B adults unbanked (can't use credit cards)
- Cross-border fees: 3-5% extra
- Currency conversion: another 2-3%

**Why Hasn't This Been Solved?**
- Credit card networks are a duopoly (Visa, Mastercard)
- High barriers to entry (compliance, banking relationships)
- Merchants have no choice (customers expect credit cards)

**Enter Stablecoins**: All the benefits of crypto, none of the volatility

---

## Slide 5: Our Solution (Technical Deep Dive)
**Title**: How We Actually Work (Under the Hood)

**Architecture**:

**Frontend** (Customer-Facing):
- Hosted checkout page (Vite + React)
- Wallet connection (wagmi + viem)
- Real-time status updates (Server-Sent Events)

**Backend** (API):
- Fastify (TypeScript)
- PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM
- JWT authentication
- Webhook delivery (with signatures)

**Blockchain Layer**:
- Ethereum + Polygon support
- USDC/USDT (ERC-20 tokens)
- ethers.js for blockchain interaction
- Alchemy/Infura for RPC access

**Security**:
- Non-custodial (merchant controls wallet)
- API keys + JWT tokens
- Rate limiting (5 requests/15min on auth)
- Webhook HMAC signatures
- Security headers (helmet)

**Flow**:
1. Merchant creates payment session via API
2. Customer redirects to hosted checkout
3. Customer connects wallet (MetaMask/WalletConnect)
4. Customer approves USDC transfer
5. Blockchain confirms transaction (30-120 seconds)
6. Webhook fires to merchant's server
7. Merchant fulfills order

**Key Technical Decisions**:
- **Why non-custodial?** No money transmitter license needed
- **Why stablecoins only?** No volatility risk
- **Why Polygon?** Low gas fees ($0.01 vs $5 on Ethereum)
- **Why TypeScript?** Type safety, great DX

---

## Slide 6: Competitive Landscape (Honest Assessment)
**Title**: Who We're Competing Against (and Why We'll Win)

**Direct Competitors**:

1. **Coinbase Commerce**
   - Pros: Brand recognition, $1B+ GMV
   - Cons: Supports volatile coins (BTC, ETH), basic API, 1% fee
   - Our advantage: Stablecoin-only + better UX + 0.5% fee

2. **BitPay**
   - Pros: Established (10+ years), $1B+ GMV
   - Cons: Custodial, clunky UX, 1% fee
   - Our advantage: Non-custodial + modern UX

3. **Stripe Crypto** (if they launch)
   - Pros: Brand, distribution, existing merchants
   - Cons: 1.5% fee (still expensive), not core focus
   - Our advantage: 0.5% fee, crypto-native

**Indirect Competitors**:

4. **Stripe/PayPal** (traditional)
   - Pros: Everyone uses them, trusted
   - Cons: 2.9% fees, slow settlement
   - Our advantage: 5x cheaper, instant settlement

5. **Web3 Wallets** (MetaMask, Rainbow)
   - Pros: Direct peer-to-peer payments
   - Cons: No merchant tools, no checkout flow
   - Our advantage: Full payment infrastructure

**Why We'll Win**:
1. **Developer Experience** - We're the only ones with Stripe-quality DX
2. **Non-Custodial** - Regulatory moat (no money transmitter licenses)
3. **Stablecoin-Only** - No volatility = merchant confidence
4. **Network Effects** - Best API → most developers → most merchants
5. **Timing** - First to market with this exact product

**Threats**:
- Stripe clones us (likely in 2-3 years)
- Regulation kills stablecoins (low probability post-2025 legislation)
- Crypto adoption stalls (mitigated by 300M existing users)

---

## Slide 7: Business Model (Unit Economics)
**Title**: How We Make Money (and How Much)

**Revenue Model**:
- Transaction fee: 0.5% per successful payment
- No monthly fees, no setup fees, no withdrawal fees

**Unit Economics** (Average Merchant):
- Monthly volume: $20,000
- Our revenue (0.5%): **$100/month**
- Our cost (infrastructure): $2/month
- **Gross profit**: $98/month (98% margin)

**Customer Economics**:
- CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost): $50-$100
  - Product-led growth (SEO, content, community)
  - No sales team needed (initially)
- LTV (Lifetime Value): $2,000-$5,000
  - Average merchant stays 2+ years
  - Average merchant: $100/month revenue
  - **LTV:CAC = 20-50:1** ✅

**Scaling Economics**:
- Infrastructure costs: ~$10k/month at $1M ARR (1% of revenue)
- Support costs: ~$20k/month at $1M ARR (2% of revenue)
- **Target gross margin**: 80% at scale

**Path to $10M ARR**:
- 10,000 merchants × $100/month = $1M/month = $12M ARR
- OR 1,000 merchants × $1,000/month = $12M ARR
- OR 100 enterprise merchants × $10k/month = $12M ARR

**Pricing Power**:
- We're 5x cheaper than Stripe (0.5% vs 2.9%)
- We could charge 1% and still be 3x cheaper
- Room to raise prices as we add features

---

## Slide 8: Go-to-Market (Customer Acquisition)
**Title**: How We Get Merchants

**Phase 1** (Months 1-3): **Founder-Led Sales**
- Target: 10-50 crypto-native SaaS founders
- Channel: Direct outreach, YC network, founder community
- Goal: Validate PMF, collect feedback
- Cost: $0 (founder time only)

**Phase 2** (Months 4-6): **Product-Led Growth**
- Target: Indie hackers, small SaaS companies
- Channels:
  - Content marketing (SEO for "Stripe alternatives")
  - Product Hunt launch
  - Indie Hackers community
  - Hacker News posts
  - Open source SDKs (GitHub stars)
- Goal: 100-500 merchants
- Cost: $5k/month (content, ads)

**Phase 3** (Months 7-12): **Partnerships & Integrations**
- Target: E-commerce stores (Shopify, WooCommerce)
- Channels:
  - WooCommerce plugin (free)
  - Shopify app (free)
  - Integration marketplace listings
  - Affiliate program (merchants refer merchants)
- Goal: 1,000-5,000 merchants
- Cost: $10k/month (engineering + marketing)

**Phase 4** (Year 2+): **Enterprise Sales**
- Target: Large merchants ($1M+ monthly volume)
- Channels:
  - Direct sales team (1-2 AEs)
  - Case studies
  - Conference sponsorships
- Goal: 10-50 enterprise customers
- Cost: $50k/month (sales team + events)

**Why This Works**:
- Bottom-up adoption (developers choose us)
- Self-serve onboarding (no sales calls needed)
- Network effects (more devs → more integrations → more merchants)

---

- Series A ($5M) Year 2 (to accelerate)

---

## Slide 10: Risks (What Could Go Wrong)
**Title**: Honest Assessment of Risks

**Category 1: Market Risks**

**Risk**: Stablecoin adoption doesn't grow
- Probability: LOW (already 300M users, growing 50% YoY)
- Mitigation: Target existing crypto users first (wedge strategy)

**Risk**: Merchants don't care about fees
- Probability: LOW (fees are #2 pain point per surveys)
- Mitigation: Focus on thin-margin industries (e-commerce, SaaS)

**Category 2: Competitive Risks**

**Risk**: Stripe clones us
- Probability: MEDIUM (they'll notice if we get traction)
- Mitigation:
  - Build moat with developer love (like Stripe did vs PayPal)
  - Non-custodial advantage (Stripe would need licenses)
  - Move fast, capture market before they react

**Risk**: Coinbase Commerce improves UX
- Probability: MEDIUM
- Mitigation: Stay ahead on features, maintain UX edge

**Category 3: Technical Risks**

**Risk**: Blockchain outage (Ethereum/Polygon down)
- Probability: LOW (99.9%+ uptime historically)
- Mitigation: Multi-chain support, fallback RPC providers

**Risk**: Smart contract bug (USDC exploit)
- Probability: VERY LOW (USDC audited, $40B market cap)
- Mitigation: Insurance (optional), use only audited tokens

**Category 4: Regulatory Risks**

**Risk**: Stablecoins get banned
- Probability: VERY LOW (2025 legislation clarified this)
- Mitigation:
  - Non-custodial = less regulatory burden
  - Have legal counsel on retainer
  - Pivot to fiat if needed

**Risk**: Money transmitter license required
- Probability: LOW (non-custodial exemption clear)
- Mitigation: Legal opinion obtained, can pivot to custodial if needed

**Category 5: Execution Risks**

**Risk**: Can't hire fast enough
- Probability: MEDIUM
- Mitigation: Start with contractors, remote-first, competitive equity

**Risk**: Co-founders disagree / leave
- Probability: MEDIUM (50% of startups fail here)
- Mitigation: Vesting schedule (4 years, 1-year cliff), clear roles, open communication

**Overall Assessment**:
Medium risk, high reward. Most risks are manageable.

---

## Slide 11: Equity & Compensation
**Title**: How We Split the Pie (Honestly)

**Current Cap Table** (if solo founder):
- Founder (you): 100%
- Reserved for employees: 0% (will reserve 10-20% post-seed)
- Investors: 0%

**Co-Founder Equity** (depends on stage they join):

**If joining Day 1** (before product launch):
- Equal split: 50/50 (if equal contribution)
- Or weighted by experience: 60/40, 70/30

**If joining Month 1-3** (product live, no revenue):
- 20-40% (depends on role criticality)
- Example: CTO → 30%, Head of Growth → 20%

**If joining Month 6+** (revenue, traction):
- 10-20% (later stage)
- Plus competitive salary

**Vesting**:
- 4-year vest, 1-year cliff
- Acceleration on acquisition (50-100%)
- Standard Silicon Valley terms

**Compensation** (beyond equity):

**Pre-Funding** (bootstrapped):
- Equity only (sweat equity)
- Or minimal salary ($2k-$5k/month if profitable)

**Post-Seed** ($500k raised):
- Market salary (80% of Big Tech)
- Example: $120k for senior engineer (vs $150k at Google)
- Plus equity

**Post-Series A** ($5M raised):
- Market salary (100% of Big Tech)
- Plus equity refresh grants

**What This Could Be Worth** (10-year horizon):

**Conservative Exit** ($50M acquisition):
- 30% co-founder stake → $15M payout 🎉

**Optimistic Exit** ($500M acquisition or IPO):
- 20% co-founder stake → $100M payout 🚀

**Likely Outcome** (based on startup stats):
- 70% chance: $0 (startup fails)
- 20% chance: $1M-$10M (acqui-hire or modest exit)
- 9% chance: $10M-$100M (successful exit)
- 1% chance: $100M+ (home run)

**Key Point**: We're optimizing for the 10% success case, but being honest about the 70% failure risk.

---

## Slide 13: Culture & Working Style
**Title**: How We Work (Expectations)

**Our Values**:
1. **Merchants First** - Every decision optimizes for merchant value
2. **Move Fast** - Bias toward shipping (iterate, don't perfect)
3. **Radical Transparency** - Open financials, open roadmap, open feedback
4. **Intellectual Honesty** - Admit when we're wrong, pivot quickly
5. **Work-Life Balance** - Sprint when needed, rest when you can

**Working Style**:
- **Remote-first** (work from anywhere)
- **Async-first** (respect timezones, document decisions)
- **High autonomy** (own your domain, don't ask permission)
- **High trust** (assume good intent, fix processes not people)

**Time Commitment**:
- **Year 1** (bootstrap): 60-80 hours/week (intense)
- **Year 2+** (funded): 50-60 hours/week (sustainable)
- **Expectations**: Weekdays are intense, weekends are optional

**Communication**:
- **Daily**: Async standup (what you did, what you're doing, blockers)
- **Weekly**: 1-hour sync call (strategy, decisions, alignment)
- **Monthly**: Metrics review, retrospective, planning

**Decision-Making**:
- **Small decisions** (<$1k, reversible): Just do it
- **Medium decisions** ($1k-$10k, impactful): Discuss with co-founder(s)
- **Big decisions** (>$10k, strategic): Full team alignment

**Conflict Resolution**:
- Disagree and commit (state your case, then support the decision)
- Escalate to CEO if can't resolve (rare)
- Never let disagreements fester

---

## Slide 14: Funding Strategy
**Title**: How We'll Finance Growth

**Stage 1** (Months 1-6): **Bootstrap**
- Funding: $0 (sweat equity)
- Goal: Validate PMF, get to profitability
- Metrics: 100 merchants, $50k revenue/month
- Burn: $0-$5k/month (minimal infrastructure)

**Stage 2** (Months 6-12): **Seed Round** (Optional)
- Raise: $500k @ $4M pre-money valuation
- Dilution: 12.5% (co-founders keep 87.5%)
- Use: Hire 2-3 people, marketing budget
- Goal: 1,000 merchants, $100k revenue/month
- Investors: Angels, YC, small funds

**Stage 3** (Year 2): **Series A**
- Raise: $5M @ $20M pre-money valuation
- Dilution: 25% (co-founders have ~65% remaining)
- Use: Hire 10 people, expand internationally
- Goal: 5,000 merchants, $1M revenue/month
- Investors: a16z, Paradigm, Sequoia (crypto-focused VCs)

**Stage 4** (Year 3-4): **Series B**
- Raise: $20M @ $100M pre-money valuation
- Dilution: 20% (co-founders have ~50% remaining)
- Use: Enterprise sales, fiat on-ramp, scale
- Goal: 20,000 merchants, $5M revenue/month

**Alternative Path** (if bootstrap successful):
- Don't raise Seed (stay profitable)
- Raise Series A only when hitting scale constraints
- Maintain more ownership (70%+ for co-founders)

**Exit Timeline**:
- Year 5: Acquisition ($50M-$200M)
- Year 7: IPO ($500M-$2B valuation)
- Year 10: Public company ($5B+ valuation)

**Co-Founder Dilution Model**:

| Stage | Raise | Pre-$ | Dilution | Co-Founder % |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|--------------|
| Start | - | - | - | 50% (each) |
| Seed | $500k | $4M | 12.5% | 43.75% |
| Series A | $5M | $20M | 25% | 32.8% |
| Series B | $20M | $100M | 20% | 26.2% |
| Exit | - | $500M | - | $131M each |

**Key Point**: We dilute slowly, maintain control, optimize for outcome.

3. How do you handle stress? (Emotional resilience)
4. What's your commitment level? (All-in or side project?)
5. What if we raise funding and you want to sell but I don't? (Exit alignment)

## Slide 17: Working Agreement (If We Partner)
**Title**: How We'll Operate as Co-Founders

**Equity Split**:
- [Your %] / [Co-founder %] (based on contribution, stage, etc.)
- 4-year vesting, 1-year cliff
- Both have board seats (control)

**Roles & Responsibilities**:
- CEO (you): Strategy, fundraising, vision, final decisions
- [Co-founder role]: [Domain ownership]
- Weekly syncs, monthly planning

**Decision Rights**:
- Small: Either can decide (<$1k, reversible)
- Medium: Discuss, consensus preferred ($1k-$10k)
- Large: Must agree (>$10k, strategic pivots)
- Tie-breaker: CEO (you) has final say

**Compensation**:
- Year 1: Equity only (bootstrap)
- Post-funding: Market salary (80% of Big Tech)
- Expenses: Company pays (within reason)

**Exit Preferences**:
- Alignment on timeline (3-5 year minimum, 10 year max)
- Both must approve acquisition offers
- IPO is shared goal

**Conflict Resolution**:
1. Talk it out (90% of issues)
2. External mediator (coach, advisor)
3. Buyout clause (one co-founder can buy out the other at fair value)

**Separation Scenarios**:
- Fired for cause: Vesting stops, no acceleration
- Leaves voluntarily: Vesting stops, keep vested shares
- Mutual agreement: Negotiate buyout

**IP & Non-Compete**:
- All IP belongs to company
- 2-year non-compete (can't start competing company)
- 1-year non-solicit (can't poach employees)

## Slide 18: Success Metrics (How We'll Know We're Winning)
**Title**: What Good Looks Like (6-Month Checkpoints)

**Month 6** (Private Beta Success):
- ✅ 50+ merchants onboarded
- ✅ $500k payment volume processed
- ✅ $2,500 revenue (0.5% of volume)
- ✅ 90%+ merchant retention
- ✅ NPS > 50
- ✅ Break-even or profitable

**Month 12** (Public Launch Success):
- ✅ 500 merchants onboarded
- ✅ $10M payment volume
- ✅ $50k revenue ($600k ARR run rate)
- ✅ Seed funding secured ($500k) OR fully bootstrapped
- ✅ 3-5 person team hired

**Month 18** (Product-Market Fit):
- ✅ 1,000+ merchants
- ✅ $50M volume
- ✅ $250k revenue ($3M ARR run rate)
- ✅ Organic growth (word of mouth)
- ✅ Expansion features launched (subscriptions, refunds)

**Month 24** (Series A Ready):
- ✅ 2,000+ merchants
- ✅ $200M volume
- ✅ $1M revenue ($12M ARR run rate)
- ✅ Series A raised ($5M+)
- ✅ 10-15 person team

**If We Don't Hit These**:
- Pivot: Try different customer segment or pricing
- Shutdown: Return money to investors (if any), get jobs
- Acqui-hire: Sell to larger company for $1M-$5M

**Key Indicators of Failure** (shut down if):
- Month 12: <100 merchants (no PMF)
- Month 18: Declining volume (churn > growth)
- Month 24: <$500k ARR (can't raise Series A)

## Slide 19: The Honest Truth (What I'm Not Telling VCs)
**Title**: Full Transparency on Challenges

**Things That Scare Me**:

1. **Stripe Could Clone Us**
   - They have brand, distribution, capital
   - If we get traction, they'll notice
   - Mitigation: Move fast, build moat before they react

2. **Regulation Could Change**
   - Stablecoins could be re-classified
   - KYC/AML requirements could be added
   - Mitigation: Non-custodial exemption, legal counsel

3. **Crypto Adoption Could Stall**
   - If crypto winter returns, merchants won't care
   - Mitigation: 300M users already, wedge with crypto-native first

4. **I Might Not Be the Right CEO**
   - First-time founder, no payments experience
   - Might need to hire experienced CEO later
   - Mitigation: Advisor network, willing to learn

5. **Co-Founder Relationship Could Break**
   - 50% of startups fail due to co-founder conflicts
   - We might disagree on strategy, equity, exit
   - Mitigation: Honest communication, trial period, working agreement

**What I'm Unsure About**:
- Pricing: Is 0.5% right, or should it be 0.3% or 1%?
- Customer segment: Crypto-native first, or mainstream first?
- Fundraising: Bootstrap or raise Seed early?
- International: Stay US-only or expand globally?

**What I Need Help With**:
- Engineering (if you're CTO): I'm not technical enough
- Sales (if you're COO): I'm more product-focused than sales
- Persistence: I need someone to keep me going when it's hard

## Slide 20: Why Now? Why Me? Why You?
**Title**: The Final Pitch

**Why Now?**
- Stablecoins hit critical mass (300M users)
- Regulation is clear (2025 legislation passed)
- Merchants desperate for alternatives (Stripe raised fees 3x)
- **This is a 5-year window** - if we don't do it now, someone else will

**Why Me?** (Your strengths):
- [Your background - e.g., "Ex-Stripe engineer, built payment systems"]
- [Your insight - e.g., "Lost $50k to Stripe fees at last startup - I feel the pain"]
- [Your network - e.g., "YC alumni, can intro to 100+ potential customers"]
- [Your commitment - e.g., "All-in, $50k personal capital invested"]

**Why You?** (What you bring):
- [Technical skills - e.g., "Solidity expert, built 3 DeFi protocols"]
- [Domain expertise - e.g., "10 years in payments, worked at PayPal"]
- [Complementary - e.g., "I'm business, you're engineering - perfect fit"]
- [Belief - e.g., "You've been waiting for this opportunity"]

**Why Together?**
- Complementary skills (business + technical, or product + growth)
- Shared values (transparency, speed, customer obsession)
- Long-term alignment (both want to build for 5-10 years)
- Chemistry (we actually like working together)

**The Opportunity**:
- $93B market (payment fees)
- 1% capture = $150M revenue company
- Your equity: 20-40% = $30M-$60M outcome

**The Risk**:
- 70% chance we fail
- 3-5 years of hard work
- Opportunity cost ($500k+ in Big Tech salaries)

**The Reward** (if we win):
- Financial: $10M-$100M outcome
- Impact: Help merchants save billions
- Legacy: Build the Stripe of Stablecoins

**My Ask**:
Let's take 6-8 weeks to decide:
- Week 1-2: You review everything
- Week 3-4: We work on a project together
- Week 5-6: Trial period, see if we click
- Week 7-8: Make the decision

**If yes**: We formalize, start building, change the world.
**If no**: No hard feelings, stay friends, maybe collaborate later.
