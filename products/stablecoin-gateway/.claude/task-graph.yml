  description: Rapid prototype workflow for concept validation
tasks:
- id: CONCEPT-01
  name: Define Prototype Concept
  description: 'Create lightweight concept document for: Stable coin payment gateway
    for merchants to accept USDC/USDT payments


    Focus on:

    - Core problem being solved

    - Target user (1 persona only)

    - Key features for prototype (3-5 max)

    - Success criteria for prototype

    - What we''re testing/validating

    - Time budget (recommend 2-4 hours max)


    DO NOT create full PRD - just enough to build a testable prototype.

  description: 'Make rapid tech stack decisions for prototype.


    Focus on:

    - Choose fastest path to working prototype

    - Prefer: Vite + React for frontend, no backend unless required

    - Document in 1 ADR only (tech stack choice)

    - No detailed architecture - just "how we''ll build this fast"


    Output: Single ADR + update addendum with tech choices

  name: Build Working Prototype
  description: 'Build minimal working prototype with 3-5 key features only.


    Guidelines:

    - Hardcode data (no database)

    - Skip authentication

    - Minimal styling (Tailwind utility classes only)

    - Focus on core functionality only

    - Write minimal tests (happy path only, ~10 tests max)

    - Use placeholder text/images

    - Don''t worry about edge cases

    - Goal: Something CEO can click through and test


    Time budget: 90-120 minutes MAX


    Output: Working prototype that demonstrates the concept

    Check:

    - App loads without errors

    - Key features are clickable/functional

    - No console errors

    - Basic visual verification


    DO NOT run full testing gate - just verify it works.
