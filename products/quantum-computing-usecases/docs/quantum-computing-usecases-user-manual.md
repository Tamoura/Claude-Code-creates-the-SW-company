## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: What is quantum computing?**

A: Quantum computing uses quantum mechanical phenomena (superposition, entanglement) to process information in ways classical computers cannot. This enables solving certain problems exponentially faster.

**Q: Do I need to understand quantum physics?**

A: No. This platform explains practical applications in plain language. Technical details are provided for those interested, but not required to understand business value.

**Q: Are any quantum use cases production-ready today?**

A: Yes. Post-quantum cryptography and certain optimization problems can be solved with current quantum computers or quantum-inspired algorithms. However, most applications are still 3-10 years from widespread use.

**Q: How do I know which use case applies to my business?**

A: Use the industry and problem type filters. Read full use case descriptions to understand if the problem matches your needs. Use the comparison tool to evaluate multiple options.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What are qubits?**

A: Qubits (quantum bits) are the basic unit of quantum information. Unlike classical bits (0 or 1), qubits can be in superposition of both states simultaneously.

**Q: What is gate depth?**

A: Gate depth measures the number of sequential quantum operations (gates) in an algorithm. Higher depth requires better error correction and longer coherence times.

**Q: What is coherence time?**

A: The time qubits can maintain their quantum state before environmental noise causes errors. Longer coherence times enable more complex algorithms.

**Q: What companies offer quantum computing?**

A: Major providers include IBM Quantum, Google Quantum AI, Amazon Braket, Microsoft Azure Quantum, IonQ, Rigetti, and D-Wave (for specific problems).
