# New Product Workflow Task Graph Template

# TRACEABILITY RULES (Constitution Article VI):
#   - Every task MUST have story_ids and/or requirement_ids once PRD exists
#   - Planning tasks (PRD-01, ARCH-01) create stories — they link to epics instead
#   - Foundation tasks link to foundation stories defined in the PRD
#   - Commits MUST include [US-XX] or [FR-XXX] in the message
#   - Tests MUST reference acceptance criteria IDs in test names
#   - E2E tests MUST be organized by story: e2e/tests/stories/{story-id}/

      Analyze CEO brief: {DESCRIPTION}
      Create comprehensive PRD with:
      - User personas and stories (each with unique ID: US-01, US-02, etc.)
      - Core features and MVP scope
      - Functional requirements (FR-001, FR-002, etc.)
      - Non-functional requirements (NFR-001, NFR-002, etc.)
      - Success metrics
      - Technical constraints
      - Create product addendum (.claude/addendum.md)

      TRACEABILITY: This task CREATES the requirement IDs. Every user story
      must have a unique ID (US-XX) and every requirement must have a unique
      ID (FR-XXX / NFR-XXX). These IDs are used by ALL downstream tasks.
