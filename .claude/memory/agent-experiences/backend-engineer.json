      "summary": "Implemented blockchain verification system for payment transactions. Created BlockchainMonitorService using ethers.js to verify transactions on-chain (recipient, token, amount). Integrated verification into PATCH endpoint - now requires tx_hash and verifies before allowing CONFIRMING/COMPLETED status. Prevents payment fraud via fake transactions. All 15 blockchain tests passing."

  "common_mistakes": [
    "Always hash tokens (refresh, API keys) with SHA-256 before storing in database — never store plaintext",

    "Route → Schema → Handler → Service → Prisma: keep route files thin, business logic in services",
    "AppError class with toJSON() for consistent RFC 7807 responses across all endpoints",
    "buildApp() in test files: create real Fastify instance with real database, use app.inject() for testing",
