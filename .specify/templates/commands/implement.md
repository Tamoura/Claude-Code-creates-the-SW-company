You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

Execute the task list generated by `/speckit.tasks`. This command orchestrates implementation by delegating to ConnectSW specialist agents.

### Execution Steps

1. **Pre-flight checks**:
   - Read `products/[product]/docs/tasks.md` — task list to execute
   - Read `products/[product]/docs/plan.md` — technical context
   - Read `products/[product]/docs/specs/[feature-name].md` — requirements
   - Optionally read: data-model.md, contracts/, research.md
   - Verify no `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers remain in spec
   - Check if `/speckit.analyze` has been run (recommended before implementation)

2. **Checklist verification** (if exists):
   - Scan `products/[product]/docs/checklists/` for checklist files
   - Count completed vs. incomplete items
   - If incomplete items found: warn and ask user to confirm proceeding

3. **Task execution** — phase by phase:
   - **Phase 1 (Setup)**: Execute directly — project scaffolding, configs
   - **Phase 2 (Foundation)**: Delegate to Backend Engineer + Frontend Engineer
     - Parallel tasks ([P]) can use git worktrees
     - Backend: `apps/api/` tasks → Backend Engineer agent
     - Frontend: `apps/web/` tasks → Frontend Engineer agent
   - **Phase 3+ (User Stories)**: For each story:
     - Tests first (TDD Red) → delegate to appropriate engineer
     - Implementation (TDD Green) → delegate to same engineer
     - Story checkpoint → verify tests pass
   - **Phase N (Polish)**: Run `/speckit.analyze`, update docs, run quality gates

4. **Progress tracking**:
   - Mark completed tasks with `[x]` in tasks.md
   - Report progress per phase
   - If a task fails: halt non-parallel tasks, report error, suggest fix

5. **Completion validation**:
   - All tasks marked complete
   - All tests pass
   - Implementation matches spec requirements
   - `/speckit.analyze` passes (no CRITICAL findings)
   - Quality gates pass (browser-first, security, testing)

6. **Report**:
   - Tasks completed vs. total
   - Test results
   - Quality gate results
   - Any issues encountered
   - Ready for CEO checkpoint?

### Agent Delegation Map

| Task Type | Agent | Working Directory |
|-----------|-------|------------------|
| Database schema, migrations | Data Engineer | apps/api/ |
| API routes, business logic | Backend Engineer | apps/api/ |
| React components, pages | Frontend Engineer | apps/web/ |
| E2E tests, visual verification | QA Engineer | e2e/ |
| CI/CD, Docker | DevOps Engineer | project root |
| API docs, user guides | Technical Writer | docs/ |

### ConnectSW Conventions

- Use git worktrees for parallel backend/frontend work
- Stage specific files only (never `git add .`)
- Commit after each passing test (green phase)
- Follow conventional commits format
- Check COMPONENT-REGISTRY.md before building any new component
