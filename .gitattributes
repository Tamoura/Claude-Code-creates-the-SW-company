# Merge strategies for parallel product development
#
# Problem: When two Claude sessions work on different products simultaneously,
# PRs can conflict on shared root config files that neither session changed
# intentionally.
#
# merge=ours:  On conflict, keeps the version on the target branch (main).
#              Safe because root config changes are rare and deliberate.
#              If a PR intentionally modifies these, re-apply after merge.
#
# merge=union: On conflict, keeps lines from both sides.
#              Works for append-only files with independent entries.

# Root configs - keep main's version on conflict
