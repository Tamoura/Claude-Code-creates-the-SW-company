## Competitive Moats

1. **Quality Guarantee**: 4-gate system guarantees zero errors on first run (no competitor offers this)
2. **Agent Memory & Learning**: Network effects from 1,000+ products built
3. **Workflow Templates**: 7 proven workflows refined over real product builds
4. **Brand & Trust**: Reputation for actually shipping working products
5. **Ecosystem**: Marketplace + integrations create switching costs
6. **Enterprise Relationships**: White-label + custom agents create lock-in

**Defensibility Timeline**: Competitor would need 2-3 years to match quality + brand + ecosystem.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Claude API costs too high | High | Multi-model strategy (GPT-5, Gemini), prompt optimization, usage caps |
| Customers prefer human devs | High | Quality-first positioning, transparency, hybrid human-in-loop option |
| Anthropic changes pricing | Critical | Multi-model architecture, enterprise contracts, self-hosted option |
| Competitors catch up | High | Speed to market, build defensible moats, focus on quality not features |
| Quality issues damage reputation | Critical | 4-gate quality system, transparent post-mortems, insurance policy |

---

## Recommended Path: **Bootstrap + Agency Hedge**

### Strategy
1. **Month 1-3**: Bootstrap, build v1.0, launch with Product Hunt
2. **Month 2-3**: Simultaneously approach agencies for white-label pilots
3. **Month 3-6**: Dual-track direct sales ($149/mo) + agency partnerships ($10K-20K/mo)
4. **Month 6**: Decision point based on which channel is stronger

### Why This Works
- **Optionality**: Two paths to revenue
- **Validation**: Real customers + agencies using product
- **Derisking**: If one channel fails, other can carry
- **Control**: No investors unless we choose to raise

### Alternative Path
If founder prefers speed over control: Raise $2M seed, hire 5-person team, aggressive customer acquisition, target $500K-1.5M MRR by Month 12.

## Key Questions for CEO

Before finalizing strategy, need input on:

1. **Vision**: Build to $10M and sell? $100M+ and IPO? Stay small and profitable?
2. **Risk Tolerance**: Bootstrap (slow, controlled) or raise (fast, dilution)?
3. **Pricing**: Is $149 Pro tier right? Free tier forever or trial-only?
4. **Go-to-Market**: Founder-led public (Twitter, podcasts)? Pursue agencies aggressively?
5. **Team**: When to hire first employee? Month 1, 6, or 12?
6. **Fundraising**: Comfortable with 20-30% dilution and VC expectations?
7. **Launch Timing**: 30 days (fast, scrappy) or 90 days (polished, more features)?

---

## The Bottom Line

**Market Opportunity**: $30B+ and growing fast (42% CAGR)

**Unique Value**: Only autonomous dev platform with quality guarantees and proven results

**Revenue Potential**: $7.7M ARR conservative, $22M ARR optimistic (Year 1)

**Capital Efficient**: Can bootstrap to profitability in 7 months with $510K

**Competitive Position**: 2-3 year head start on moats if we execute fast

**Risk Level**: Medium (API dependency, competition) but highly mitigatable

**Recommendation**: Launch in 30 days, bootstrap with agency hedge, reach 100 paying customers in 90 days, then decide whether to scale bootstrapped or raise seed.
