## 6. Current Pain Points & Gaps

### 6.1 What's Missing in Deal Flow / Investment Access

**For Retail Investors:**
1. **No digital-first investment platform** -- No Qatari equivalent of Robinhood, Wealthsimple, or Sarwa (UAE). Retail investors must use traditional bank-affiliated brokerages.
2. **Limited fund selection** -- Only 2 locally-listed ETFs (QETF, QATR). No fund supermarket or multi-manager platform.
3. **No fractional share investing** -- Cannot buy portions of expensive QSE stocks.
4. **Sukuk access is institutional** -- Retail investors have very limited access to the sukuk primary market. The QInvest Sukuk Fund exists but has high minimums.
5. **IPO access is broker-dependent** -- Subscriptions go through brokerage accounts with no unified digital IPO platform.
6. **No crowdfunding/P2P investment platform live yet** -- Barzah and others are in incubation/sandbox stages.
7. **No robo-advisory service** -- Despite high digital adoption (99.7% internet, 90% smartphones), no automated portfolio management exists.

**For Institutional / Sophisticated Investors:**
1. **No derivatives market yet** -- DMEX framework exists but the exchange is not operational.
2. **Thin IPO pipeline** -- Only 1 company in pipeline for 2025 vs. 27 in KSA.
3. **Limited REIT offerings** -- Framework exists but few domestic REITs.
4. **No CCP operational** -- Counterparty risk management is basic.
5. **Regulatory opacity** -- No formal public consultation on regulations; limited transparency in government procurement.

**For the Ecosystem:**
1. **Open banking not yet mandated** -- QNB is voluntary; QCB framework expected 2026.
2. **Bureaucratic friction** -- Business formation slow despite legal reforms.
3. **Talent shortage** -- Demand for tech/financial professionals exceeds local supply.
4. **Small market size** -- 54 listed companies, ~$177B market cap. Limited diversification options.

## Summary: Key Opportunities Identified

1. **Digital Investment Platform Gap** -- No Qatari-built, digital-first investment platform exists for retail investors. This is the single largest gap given 99.7% internet penetration, 90% smartphone adoption, 26,000+ millionaires, and a high-income population.

2. **Sukuk Retail Access** -- The sukuk market is booming (QSE's first Islamic sukuk in 2025, strong sovereign issuance), but retail access remains institutional. Tokenized sukuk and fractional access are emerging globally.

3. **Fund Distribution** -- Only 2 local ETFs. No fund supermarket or multi-fund platform. Mutual fund access is branch-based with high minimums.

4. **IPO Democratization** -- Qatar's IPO pipeline is thin but growing. A digital IPO subscription platform would serve the market.

5. **Open Banking Infrastructure** -- QCB framework expected 2026. Early movers building on open APIs (QNB already live) could capture the market.

6. **Derivatives & Structured Products** -- DMEX framework enables it, LSEG partnership in place, but no live market yet. First-mover opportunity.

7. **Cross-Border Investment** -- Qatari investors want international exposure. No local platform bridges QSE + GCC + global markets in a unified experience.

8. **Sharia-Compliant Innovation** -- Large Islamic finance market but limited innovation in retail Islamic products (crowdfunding, fractional REITs, etc.)
