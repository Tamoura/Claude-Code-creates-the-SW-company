# Product Rename: TestPilot -> Motqen

## Summary

Renamed the product from "TestPilot" to "Motqen" across all planning
documents.

## Name Meaning

**Motqen** (متقن) - Arabic for "The one who perfects", from the concept
of إتقان (itqan) - excellence and mastery in work.

## Changes Made

1. **Directory rename**: `products/testpilot/` -> `products/motqen/`
2. **PRD.md**: All TestPilot -> Motqen, all CLI commands testpilot ->
   motqen, npm packages @testpilot -> @motqen, GitHub Action
   connectsw/motqen-action, config file motqen.config.ts, env var
   MOTQEN_API_KEY
3. **Strategy document**: Created `motqen-product-strategy.md` with all
   references updated. Original `testpilot-product-strategy.md` retained.

## Notes

- Story IDs remain as TP-XXX (unchanged per request)
- API key prefix remains `tp_` (data model detail, not user-facing brand)
- Old strategy file kept for reference
