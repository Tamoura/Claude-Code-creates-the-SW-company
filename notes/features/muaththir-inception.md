# Mu'aththir -- Product Inception Notes

## Product Concept
A holistic child development platform for parents tracking children ages 3-16 across 6 dimensions.

## Name
- **Arabic**: Mu'aththir
- **Meaning**: Influential / Impactful
- **Product slug**: `muaththir`

## 6 Development Dimensions
1. **Academic** -- School/learning progress, grades, milestones
2. **Social-Emotional** -- Emotional intelligence, social skills, empathy
3. **Behavioural** -- Conduct, habits, discipline, self-regulation
4. **Aspirational** -- Goals, dreams, motivation, career exploration
5. **Islamic** -- Islamic education, Quran progress, values, spiritual growth
6. **Physical** -- Health, fitness, motor skills, sports, nutrition

## Target Users
- **Primary**: Parents
- **Age range**: Children 3-16 years old
- **Audience**: Muslim families (primarily), but dimensions 1-4 and 6 are universal

## Port Assignments
- Frontend (web): 3108
- Backend (API): 5005

## Branch
- `feature/muaththir/inception`

## Current Phase
- PRD-01: Product Manager writing PRD (in progress)

## Key Decisions
- Age bands: 3-5 (Early Years), 6-9 (Primary), 10-12 (Upper Primary), 13-16 (Secondary)
- Islamic dimension woven throughout, not siloed
- MVP focuses on single-child view; multi-child is Phase 2
- Radar/spider chart is the signature visualization
- Observations are the primary data input mechanism
- Milestones are age-appropriate and dimension-specific
- Database name: muaththir_dev

## Design Philosophy
The Islamic dimension is NOT separate -- it is woven throughout:
- Ihsan (excellence) connects to academic goals
- Sabr (patience) connects to behavioural tracking
- Shukr (gratitude) connects to social-emotional
- Tawakkul (reliance on Allah) connects to aspirational

## Deliverables

2. `products/muaththir/.claude/addendum.md`
