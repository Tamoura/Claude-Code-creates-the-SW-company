# ArchForge Product Strategy -- Working Notes

**Date**: February 19, 2026
**Task**: STRATEGY-01 -- Market research and strategy document for ArchForge
**Branch**: feature/archforge/planning

## Key Market Findings

- EA tools market: ~$1.14B (2024), growing at 6% CAGR to $1.6-2.2B by 2030
- Cloud-based solutions dominate (53.71%), expected 65%+ by 2026
- SMEs are fastest-growing segment (9.48% CAGR) but underserved
- North America holds 37% market share; Healthcare is fastest-growing vertical

## Competitive Landscape

- 6 Gartner MQ Leaders: SAP LeanIX, Ardoq, MEGA HOPEX, BiZZdesign, Avolution, BOC Group
- No incumbent has AI-native artifact generation from natural language
- Ardoq most advanced on AI (Chat, Visual Importer, AI Lens) but still incremental
- Sparx Systems has 3M+ users but zero AI and no cloud strategy -- ripe for disruption
- 18-month window before incumbents catch up on AI

## Critical Gap Identified

No existing tool generates complete, standards-compliant EA artifacts (TOGAF, ArchiMate, BPMN) from natural language descriptions. This is ArchForge's core differentiator.

## Recommendation

- Proceed with development (Opportunity Score: 8.2/10)
- MVP target: August 2026 (6 months)
- PLG motion targeting SMEs first, then enterprise
- Pricing: Free tier, $49/user Pro, $99/user Team, Custom Enterprise
- Year 3 ARR target: $15-45M
