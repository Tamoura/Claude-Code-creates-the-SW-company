# ITIL Dashboard - CEO Brief

## Product Vision

A comprehensive ITIL dashboard for IT Service Management that serves multiple stakeholder levels with role-based views.

## Target Users

1. **IT Service Desk Managers** - Managing day-to-day ITSM operations, tracking KPIs and SLAs
2. **IT Operations Teams** - Real-time monitoring of IT services and operational health
3. **ITSM Executives/Directors** - Executive-level reporting and analytics on ITIL process performance

## Core Problem

IT organizations need visibility into their ITIL processes to:
- Track incident resolution and SLA compliance
- Identify recurring problems and root causes
- Monitor change success rates and reduce failed changes
- Manage service request fulfillment efficiently
- Build and maintain knowledge bases

## MVP Scope - Core 5 ITIL Processes

1. **Incident Management** - Track, prioritize, and resolve incidents with SLA tracking
2. **Problem Management** - Identify root causes, track known errors, and solutions
3. **Change Management** - Manage change requests, approvals, and implementation tracking
4. **Service Request Management** - Handle user requests and service catalog items
5. **Knowledge Management** - Build and search knowledge articles

## Technical Approach

- **Standalone Application** - Self-contained with its own database
- **Data Entry** - Users can manually enter or import data (CSV, etc.)
- **No External Integrations** - Simple MVP without ITSM tool dependencies

## Key Features

- Role-based dashboards (Executive, Manager, Operator views)
- Real-time KPI tracking and visualization
- SLA monitoring with alerts
- Reporting and analytics
- Trend analysis and insights

## Constraints

- Must follow ITIL v4 terminology and best practices
- Role-based access control required
- Must be responsive for desktop and tablet use
